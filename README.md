# Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript
## Guided by the book by Kyran Dale [Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualization-Python-JavaScript-Transform/dp/1491920513) and hosted at [this repository](https://github.com/Kyrand/dataviz-with-python-and-js)

This project is based on the visualization project described in the book above, but also contains experiments and alternatives to the approaches taken by Dale. We hope to learn a thing or two by going through this course and provide some resources for others who want to learn about web development and data visualization and analysis along the way.

# Installation
This project makes use of several technologies that may need to be installed. Manual installation guides and docker installation/usage guides will be included for each, where appropriate.
- Python
    - You will need Python. Although the [Data Visualization Book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Visualization-Python-JavaScript-Transform/dp/1491920513) suggests using Python 2, Jonathan recommends using Python 3.7 or later, in order to take advantage of the latest features.
        - There were major changes between versions 2 and 3 that make 3.x not backwards compatible with 2.x. Although 2.x continued to have support for some time and there are some enterprise holdouts that insist on using 2.x because of the costs that would be involved with migrating their codebases to 3.x, all new projects should be in 3.x, and 2.x should not be used unless necessary. See the links below for some background and discussions of differences.

    - You probably already have some version of Python installed. Check to see if you do by running `python --version`
        - See this stackOverflow question: [Which Version of Python Do I Have Installed?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8917885/which-version-of-python-do-i-have-installed)

- Javascript
- Docker
- MySQL
- MongoDB
